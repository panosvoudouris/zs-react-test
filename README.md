# Zensar React Exercise

The purpose of the exercise is to create a basic react app that displays some data it receives from a mock API.

A basic app has been setup for you in `App.js`. To get started:

```
npm install
npm start
```

A mock API is available in `api/api.js`. You need to call the `getData` function in `App.js` and display the received data in the markup available. Feel free to rearrange the markup (eg `<table>` element or anything else) to display the data how you like it, or just put it in a simple table.

Once the data is displayed then use the `<select>` element to allow the user to sort the elements via one of the options available.

## How to return the submission

Once your solution is complete either submit it as a git repository or a zip file. 

Thank you, we look forward to seeing your creation.
